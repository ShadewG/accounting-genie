## Frontend Prototype

The `frontend/` directory provides a minimal React prototype loaded via CDN
scripts. It includes a Dashboard listing receipts from Firestore and a Receipt
Detail view where the data can be edited and posted to Fiken. Configure
`frontend/firebaseConfig.js` with your Firebase project settings and then open
`frontend/index.html` in a browser to try it out.
